            <p>MapDoc is a tool developed by geeks for geeks. You can create interactive maps representing your project, your code, tag them and give them a color and a shape; next time you'll look at your code, not remembering why you wrote that piece of code in that file, where you put that feature, or how you made all the modules work together, MapDoc will help you find your way back with just a few taps!<br/>
            But it's in a collaborative environment that you can get the best out of the tool. Nowadays a always-growing part of the software you can see working is open-source, that means you can take the code, edit it, or just add a feature you really need, but still hasn't been implemented. Working with a MapDoc will make your development easier, you'll save up to 30% of the time spent reading code and trying to understand how that all works.</p>
